# Iris-Flower-Classification
Iris Flower Classification Project: Utilizing sepal and petal dimensions (length and width) as key features, this data science initiative aims to create a classification model to distinguish between various iris flower species. Through the application of machine learning algorithms and feature extraction from sepal and petal measurements, the project aims to provide accurate and efficient classification, contributing valuable insights to botanical studies and data-driven species identification.
